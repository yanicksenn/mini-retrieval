Force-wielders are very limited in numbers in comparison to the population. The
Jedi and Sith prefer the use of a weapon called a lightsaber, a blade of plasma
that can cut through virtually any surface and deflect energy bolts. The rest of
the population, as well as renegades and soldiers, use plasma-powered blaster
firearms. As a result of galaxy-scaled politics, all this weaponry is made use
of in various military conflicts during which most Star Wars material takes
place. In the outer reaches of the galaxy, crime syndicates such as the Hutt
cartel are dominant. Bounty hunters are often employed by both gangsters and
governments. Illicit activities include smuggling and slavery.
